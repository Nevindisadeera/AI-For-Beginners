Poker:

The Past:
Poker is a popular card game with many variants and has been played for centuries. Traditionally, it has been a game of psychology, strategy, and human intuition. Players relied on their ability to read opponents, bluff, and make strategic decisions based on limited information.

The Present:
AI has made remarkable strides in poker, particularly in Texas Hold'em. One of the pivotal moments in the history of AI in poker was when the AI system Libratus, developed by Carnegie Mellon University, defeated top human players in 2017. This marked a significant advancement, as poker involves hidden information, complex decision-making, and psychological elements.

AI poker bots like Pluribus, developed by Facebook AI, have shown the ability to play poker at a superhuman level, employing strategies that were previously unseen in the game. These AI systems use techniques such as reinforcement learning and extensive simulations to develop their strategies.

AI Future:
The future of AI in poker is likely to involve further advancements in strategic play, both in poker variants and in multi-player settings. AI can be used to teach and train players in various poker styles, helping them understand different strategies and refine their gameplay. Moreover, AI can contribute to the detection of cheating or irregularities in online poker, improving the integrity of the game.

AI can also be instrumental in the development of more engaging and immersive online poker experiences, creating personalized game environments, and potentially even assisting in poker-related education and research.

In conclusion, AI has brought about a revolution in poker, turning it from a predominantly human-centered game into a field where artificial intelligence plays a significant role. The future of AI in poker holds the promise of enhancing player skills, expanding game variants, and maintaining the integrity of poker in online and live settings.
